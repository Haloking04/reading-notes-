# Object basics #
1. Objects are like a physcial chart. The name of the being the person name while the infromation on the person will be the data of the object.
2. Some pros are if you wanted to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database, you could.
3. Array are use to store multiple values in a singal variable, while objects are a standalone entity, with properties and type.
4.There are some cases where you have to use brackets. For example, if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.
5. This refers to the name and age
# DOM #
1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
2.The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
